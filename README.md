# Fuel Tracker

Fuel Consumption tracker by **[pollob666](https://github.com/pollob666)**

## Getting Started

This is a simple app to track your vehicles fuel consumption. It will record whenever you are refueling and show you the Average Estimated Mileage.
It will also show if you have any savings in fuel cost by marking the record green.
In future I will try to add daily consumption and average daily fuel cost and distance traveled.
